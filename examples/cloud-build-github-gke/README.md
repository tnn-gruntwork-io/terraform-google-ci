# Cloud Build and GitHub Example

The following example shows how you can set up an automated CI/CD pipeline using [Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/)
and a [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) that is triggered from
[GitHub](https://github.com).

## What is Google Cloud Build?

Cloud Build lets you build software quickly across all languages. Get complete control over defining custom workflows
for building, testing, and deploying across multiple environments such as VMs, serverless, Kubernetes, or Firebase.
You can find out more on the [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/) website.

## Overview

In this guide we will walk through the steps necessary to set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub, Google Cloud Build and a GKE
cluster. Here are the steps:

1. [Install the necessary tools](#installing-necessary-tools)
1. [Prepare a GitHub repo with some source code to build](#preparing-the-github-repo)
1. [Configure Cloud Build](#configuring-cloud-build)
1. [Install and configure the Google Cloud Build GitHub app](#installing-the-cloud-build-github-app)
1. [Apply the Terraform code](#apply-the-terraform-code)
1. [Trigger a build by pushing changes to the GitHub repo](#triggering-a-build)
1. [View the deployment on a GKE cluster](#viewing-the-deployment)

## Installing necessary tools

In addition to `terraform`, this guide relies on the `gcloud` and `kubectl` tools to view build information and manage
the GKE cluster. This means that your system needs to be configured to be able to find `terraform`, `gcloud`, `kubectl`
client utilities on the system `PATH`. Here are the installation guides for each tool:

1. [`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/)
1. [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
1. [`terraform`](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)

Make sure the binaries are discoverable in your `PATH` variable. See [this Stack Overflow
post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14637979/how-to-permanently-set-path-on-linux-unix) for instructions on
setting up your `PATH` on Unix, and [this
post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1618280/where-can-i-set-path-to-make-exe-on-windows) for instructions on
Windows.

## Preparing the GitHub Repo

For the purposes of this example, we have prepared a [sample GitHub repository](https://github.com/tnn-gruntwork-io/sample-app-docker)
with a basic application to build. We recommend you fork this repo to your GitHub organization. In the next step, we'll configure
Cloud Build to access this repo.

## Configuring Cloud Build

Your GCP project needs to be configured properly in order to use this example. This is necessary to allow Cloud Build
to access resources such as the GKE cluster.

1. If you haven't already done so, ensure the [Cloud Build API is enabled](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=cloudbuild.googleapis.com) in your GCP project.
   - Alternatively you may run: `gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com --project=$PROJECT`
1. Next you will need to ensure the Cloud Build service account is able to access your project's GKE clusters:
   - `$ PROJECT_NUM=$(gcloud projects list --filter="$PROJECT" --format="value(PROJECT_NUMBER)" --project=$PROJECT)`
   - `$ SERVICE_ACCOUNT=${PROJECT_NUM}@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com`
   - `$ gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT --member=serviceAccount:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT --role=roles/container.developer --project=$PROJECT`

For more information on the Cloud Build service account, refer to Appendix A at the bottom of this document.

## Installing the Cloud Build GitHub app

In order to trigger builds each time you push to GitHub, we will need to install and configure the [Cloud Build GitHub App](https://github.com/marketplace/google-cloud-build).

1. Go to the [GitHub marketplace page](https://github.com/marketplace/google-cloud-build) for the Google Cloud Build app.
1. Scroll down and click 'Setup with Google Cloud Build' at the bottom of the page. **Note:** Be sure to select the correct GitHub account.
1. Decide whether to grant access to all of your repositories or just select repositories.
1. Click 'Install' and enter your GitHub password if prompted.
1. Sign in to GCP, select the designated project and check the consent checkbox.
1. Next, select the designated GitHub repo and click 'Connect repository'.
1. **Important:** On the trigger settings page be sure to click 'Skip for now' as we'll create the triggers using Terraform.
1. Click 'Done' to complete the app installation.

If you wish to modify any of the settings in the future, you can do so directly on the [Google Cloud Build GitHub app page](https://github.com/apps/google-cloud-build).

## Apply the Terraform Code

Now that we have installed the GitHub app, we are ready to deploy all of the example resources and also set up the Google Cloud Build triggers!

1. If you haven't already, clone this repo:
   - `git clone https://github.com/tnn-gruntwork-io/terraform-google-ci.git`
1. Make sure you are in the `cloud-build-github-gke` example folder:
   - `cd examples/cloud-build-github-gke`
1. Initialize terraform:
   - `terraform init`
1. Check the terraform plan:
   - `terraform plan`
1. Apply the terraform code:
   - `terraform apply`
   - Fill in the required variables based on your needs. For example:
   - `project = "project-name-123456"`
   - `region = "europe-west3"`
   - `location = "europe-west3"`
   - `github_owner = "tnn-gruntwork-io"`
   - `github_repository = "sample-app-docker"`
   - `branch_name = "master"`
   - `cluster_name = "example-private-cluster"`

This Terraform code will:

- Create a VPC network to contain the resources
- Deploy a publicly accessible GKE cluster
- Deploy a GCR repository for storing build artifacts
- Create a Cloud Build Trigger to trigger builds in response to GitHub repo changes.

At the end of `terraform apply`, you should now have a working CI/CD pipeline deployed in Google Cloud Platform.

## Triggering a Build

To trigger a build we need to commit and push some changes to the GitHub repo:

1. `$ echo $(date) >> test.txt`
1. `$ git add test.txt && git commit -m 'test commit'`
1. `$ git push origin master`

After you've pushed the changes to GitHub, Cloud Build will automatically trigger a new build. You can view the build
status directly in the [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds).

![Cloud Build History](_docs/gcp-build-history.png)

Or by using the `gcloud` CLI tool:

```
$ gcloud builds list --limit=5
```

During the build Cloud Build will install the sample app's dependencies, execute the tests, build a docker image and
push it to the GCR registry.

## Viewing the Deployment

If the build completed successfully, it should have been deployed to the GKE cluster and exposed as a service using a
Load Balancer. We can verify this by checking the output using `gcloud`:

1. View the most recent builds and copy the build id:
   - `$ gcloud builds list --limit=5`
1. Stream the logs for the most recent build and find the service details:
   - `$ gcloud builds log <BUILD_ID>`
1. Open the external IP in your browser:
   - `$ open <EXTERNAL_IP>`

Or by using the `kubectl` command:

1. Configure `kubectl` to use the GKE cluster:
   - `$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials example-private-cluster --region europe-west3`
1. List the available services:
   - `$ kubectl get services`
1. Open the external IP in your browser:
   - `$ open <EXTERNAL_IP>`

## Appendix A: Cloud Build Service Account

Cloud Build executes your builds using a service account, a special Google account that executes builds on your behalf. The email for
the Cloud Build service account is `[PROJECT_NUMBER]@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com`. When you enable the Cloud Build API, the service
account is automatically created and granted the Cloud Build Service Account role for your project. This role is sufficient for severa;
tasks, including fetching code from Cloud Source Repositories, pushing and pulling Docker images to Container Registry, however it
does not allow Cloud Build to deploy to Kubernetes Engine clusters. Therefore you need to manually enable our service account to
perform these actions by granting the account additional IAM roles. For more information, refer to: https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/securing-builds/set-service-account-permissions.
